The website allows users to upload, convert, and download files in different formats seamlessly. It runs a background conversion process, so everything feels fast and smooth for the user.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Files

Users can drag & drop files or select them manually.

The system reads the uploaded file extensions (e.g., .png, .docx, .mp4).

Uploaded files appear in a panel with their name, size, and type.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Detect Available Conversions

The website analyzes the uploaded files and determines what formats are possible:

Case 1: Single File

If one file is uploaded, all possible conversions for that format are displayed.

Example: Upload a .png ‚Üí conversion options show .jpg, .webp, .pdf.

Case 2: Multiple Files (Same Extension)

If multiple files share the same format, the system shows the conversion options for that format.

Example: Upload multiple .docx files ‚Üí options show .pdf, .txt.

Case 3: Multiple Files (Different Extensions)

If multiple files of different types are uploaded, only the common conversions appear.

Example: Upload .jpg and .png ‚Üí common option might be .pdf.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Choose Output Format

The user selects one or more output extensions from the list.

A Convert button starts the process.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Conversion Process

The backend takes over:

Images ‚Üí converted using libraries like Pillow (Python) or Sharp (Node.js)

Documents ‚Üí handled by LibreOffice CLI or similar

Audio/Video ‚Üí processed with FFmpeg

Data files ‚Üí converted with libraries for .csv, .xlsx, etc.

Each file is processed in the background.

A progress bar or spinner shows the conversion status.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Download Results

Single file upload ‚Üí Download the converted file directly.

Multiple file upload ‚Üí All converted files are automatically packed into a ZIP file.

Download links are secure and temporary (auto-delete after some time for privacy).

6Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Cleanup

Uploaded files are stored temporarily on the server.

Once the user downloads them (or after a set time), files are automatically deleted.

Encrypted links ensure only the uploader can access their converted files.
